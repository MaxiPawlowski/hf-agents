# Requesting Code Review

## Overview

Prepare clear review requests so reviewers can validate correctness, scope-fit, and risks quickly.

## Include in every review request

- User objective
- Files changed
- Known trade-offs
- Verification already run
- Specific areas needing scrutiny

## Reviewer expectations

- Confirm requested behavior is present
- Flag unrequested behavior
- Validate policy requirements for current mode
- Return pass/fail with prioritized findings
