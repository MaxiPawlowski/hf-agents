# Receiving Code Review

## Overview

Handle feedback with technical rigor: verify findings, fix the right issue, and re-check outcomes.

## Triage flow

1. Classify finding: critical, important, advisory.
2. Validate technical correctness of the feedback.
3. Apply focused fix without broad side effects.
4. Re-run relevant verification.
5. Report what changed and what remains open.

## Rules

- Do not blindly apply feedback that conflicts with requirements.
- Do not close review threads without evidence.
- Re-request review after non-trivial fixes.
